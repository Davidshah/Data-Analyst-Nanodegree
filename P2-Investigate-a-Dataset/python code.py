    The dates in our subway data are formatted in the format month-day-year.
    The dates in our weather underground data are formatted year-month-day.
    
    In order to join these two data sets together, we'll want the dates formatted
    the same way.  Write a function that takes as its input a date in the MTA Subway
    data format, and returns a date in the weather underground format.
    
    Hint: 
    There are a couple of useful functions in the datetime library that will
    help on this assignment, called strptime and strftime. 
    More info can be seen here and further in the documentation section:
    http://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.strptime

def max_temp_aggregate_by_fog(filename):
    '''
    This function should run a SQL query on a dataframe of
    weather data.  The SQL query should return two columns and
    two rows - whether it was foggy or not (0 or 1) and the max
    maxtempi for that fog value (i.e., the maximum max temperature
    for both foggy and non-foggy days).  The dataframe will be 
    titled 'weather_data'. You'll need to provide the SQL query.
    
    You might also find that interpreting numbers as integers or floats may not
    work initially.  In order to get around this issue, it may be useful to cast
    these numbers as integers.  This can be done by writing cast(column as integer).
    So for example, if we wanted to cast the maxtempi column as an integer, we would actually
    write something like where cast(maxtempi as integer) = 76, as opposed to simply 
    where maxtempi = 76.
    
    You can see the weather data that we are passing in below:
    https://www.dropbox.com/s/7sf0yqc9ykpq3w8/weather_underground.csv

def avg_weekend_temperature(filename):

    This function should run a SQL query on a dataframe of
    weather data.  The SQL query should return one column and
    one row - the average meantempi on days that are a Saturday
    or Sunday (i.e., the the average mean temperature on weekends).
    The dataframe will be titled 'weather_data' and you can access
    the date in the dataframe via the 'date' column.

    write something like where cast(maxtempi as integer) = 76, as opposed to simply 
    where maxtempi = 76.
    
    Also, you can convert dates to days of the week via the 'strftime' keyword in SQL.
    For example, cast (strftime('%w', date) as integer) will return 0 if the date
    is a Sunday or 6 if the date is a Saturday.

def fix_turnstile_data(filenames):
    '''
    Filenames is a list of MTA Subway turnstile text files. A link to an example
    MTA Subway turnstile text file can be seen at the URL below:
    http://web.mta.info/developers/data/nyct/turnstile/turnstile_110507.txt
    
    As you can see, there are numerous data points included in each row of the
    a MTA Subway turnstile text file. 

    You want to write a function that will update each row in the text
    file so there is only one entry per row. A few examples below:
    A002,R051,02-00-00,05-28-11,00:00:00,REGULAR,003178521,001100739
    A002,R051,02-00-00,05-28-11,04:00:00,REGULAR,003178541,001100746
    A002,R051,02-00-00,05-28-11,08:00:00,REGULAR,003178559,001100775
    
    Write the updates to a different text file in the format of "updated_" + filename.
    For example:
        1) if you read in a text file called "turnstile_110521.txt"
        2) you should write the updated data to "updated_turnstile_110521.txt"

    The order of the fields should be preserved. Remember to read through the 
    Instructor Notes below for more details on the task. 
    
    In addition, here is a CSV reader/writer introductory tutorial:

    and the the corresponding updated file in the links below:

    Before we perform any analysis, it might be useful to take a

    examine the hourly entries in our NYC subway data and determine what
    distribution the data follows. This data is stored in a dataframe
    called turnstile_weather under the ['ENTRIESn_hourly'] column.
    
    Let's plot two histograms on the same axes to show hourly
    entries when raining vs. when not raining. Here's an example on how
    to plot histograms with pandas and matplotlib:
    turnstile_weather['column_to_graph'].hist()
    
    Your histograph may look similar to bar graph in the instructor notes below.

    ENTRIESn_hourly column in the turnstile_weather dataframe.
    
    This function should return:
        1) the mean of entries with rain
        2) the mean of entries without rain
        3) the Mann-Whitney U-statistic and p-value comparing the number of entries
           with rain and the number of entries without rain
    
    You should feel free to use scipy's Mann-Whitney implementation, and you 
    might also find it useful to use numpy's mean function.

    The NYC turnstile data is stored in a pandas dataframe called weather_turnstile.
    Using the information stored in the dataframe, let's predict the ridership of
    the NYC subway using linear regression with gradient descent.
    
    You can download the complete turnstile weather dataframe here:
    https://www.dropbox.com/s/meyki2wl9xfa7yk/turnstile_data_master_with_weather.csv    
    
    Your prediction should have a R^2 value of 0.40 or better.
    You need to experiment using various input features contained in the dataframe. 
    We recommend that you don't use the EXITSn_hourly feature as an input to the 
    linear model because we cannot use it as a predictor: we cannot use exits 
    counts as a way to predict entry counts. 
    
    Note: Due to the memory and CPU limitation of our Amazon EC2 instance, we will
    give you a random subet (~10%) of the data contained in 
    turnstile_data_master_with_weather.csv. You are encouraged to experiment with 
    this exercise on your own computer, locally. If you do, you may want to complete Exercise
    8 using gradient descent, or limit your number of features to 10 or so, since ordinary
    least squares can be very slow for a large number of features.
    
    If you receive a "server has encountered an error" message, that means you are 
    hitting the 30-second limit that's placed on running your program. Try using a
    smaller number of features.

    performed?  Reading a bit on this webpage might be useful:

    You are passed in a dataframe called turnstile_weather. 
    Use turnstile_weather along with ggplot to make a data visualization
    focused on the MTA and weather data we used in assignment #3.  
    You should feel free to implement something that we discussed in class 
    (e.g., scatterplots, line plots, or histograms) or attempt to implement
    something more advanced if you'd like.  

    Here are some suggestions for things to investigate and illustrate:
     * Ridership by time of day or day of week
     * How ridership varies based on Subway station (UNIT)
     * Which stations have more exits or entries at different times of day
       (You can use UNIT as a proxy for subway station.)

    If you'd like to learn more about ggplot and its capabilities, take
    a look at the documentation at:

# Design an A/B Test

### Project Overview
For this project, you will consider an actual experiment that was run by Udacity. You will flesh the experiment idea out into a fully defined design, analyze the results, and propose a high-level follow-on experiment.

### Why this Project?
This project will require you to both make design decisions about how to run an A/B Test and analyze the results. Both are important skills for drawing conclusions based on online experiments.

## Clean data for visualization

Code to create a dataset that contains sex, class, and percent survived.

```{r clean, echo=FALSE}

# Update dataframe with limited variables for analysis
df <- df %>%
  select(Pclass, Sex, Survived) %>%
  group_by(Survived, Pclass, Sex) %>%
  summarize(n=n())

df2 <- df %>%
  group_by(Sex, Pclass) %>%
  mutate(SurvivalRate = n/sum(n))

df3 <- df2 %>%
  filter(Survived == 1) %>%
  select(Pclass, Sex, SurvivalRate)
```

## Export Clean Data

```{r export, echo=FALSE}

# Export to csv
write.csv(df3, file = "titanic_data_clean.csv")
```
